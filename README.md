# Human-Emotion-Recognition-System
Human Emotion Recognition System (ML)
Looks to distingush sounds of 1: "anger", 2: "bordom", 3: "fear", 4: "happy", 5: "sadness", 6: "neutral" from each other.

- The main driver is "Main.py", it has the feature extraction,selection and system modelling.

- "RandomizeFiles" is the program we wrote to split the data and handle between the different folders,
it is imported by Main.py at the start.

-results.txt is the text file containing the results (1,2,3,4,5,6) starting from the first file till the end.
